# Pomodoro Timer App with React and TypeScript

Pomodoro is a time management technique developed in the 1980s which uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Timer Description

Pomodoro timer is a simple application that keeps you focused and productive by scheduling work and break sessions consecutively. Traditionally, you have 25-minute focus sessions followed by five-minute breaks and a longer 15-minute break after four consecutive focus sessions.

The Pomodoro timer weâ€™ll be building in this tutorial implements the Pomodoro technique perfectly and tells you exactly when to work and when to take a short break. The basic process is as follows:

 - Start a 25-minute timer.
 - Work until the timer rings.
 - Take a short, five minutes break.
 - Every four pomodoros, take a longer break (15 minutes).
