# Pomodoro Timer App with React and TypeScript

Pomodoro is a time management technique developed in the 1980s which uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Timer Description

Pomodoro timer is a simple application that keeps you focused and productive by scheduling work and break sessions consecutively. Traditionally, you have 25-minute focus sessions followed by five-minute breaks and a longer 15-minute break after four consecutive focus sessions.

The Pomodoro timer we‚Äôll be building in this tutorial implements the Pomodoro technique perfectly and tells you exactly when to work and when to take a short break. The basic process is as follows:

- Start a 25-minute timer.
- Work until the timer rings.
- Take a short, five minutes break.
- Every four pomodoros, take a longer break (15 minutes).
